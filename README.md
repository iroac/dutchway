# Dutch Way
**Dutch Way** is a comprehensive React/TypeScript application designed to facilitate the learning of the Dutch language through interactive quizzes, lessons, videos, and text materials. The application encompasses four main sections, each catering to a specific aspect of language learning: Grammar, Lessons, Dictionary, and Material. Dutch Way empowers users to grasp the intricacies of the Dutch language through structured lessons and engaging learning materials.

## Key Features:

Grammar Module: Offers users a deep dive into Dutch grammar, presenting main rules and demonstrating phrase changes in past, present, and future tenses. Covers topics such as modal verbs, articles, and more.

Lessons: Provides six distinct lessons, including daily lessons, words lessons, phrases lessons, and a side-by-side lesson, fostering comprehensive language learning.

Dynamic Content: Utilizes an algorithm to ensure a balanced distribution of word and phrase-based questions from a database of over a thousand Dutch words. Automatically adjusts to focus on words when phrases are completed.

Dictionary: Equips users with access to an extensive Dutch-English word dictionary, enabling easy reference and vocabulary expansion.

Material Session: Offers curated content in the form of videos and texts in Dutch, allowing users to both consume and contribute to the learning resources.

User-Created Content: Empowers users to contribute their own content, promoting a collaborative learning environment.

Clean Layout: Developed a clean and user-friendly front-end layout using React, TypeScript, and the React Context API for efficient state management.

Security Measures: Implemented security packages and validators to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, ensuring the application's robustness.

Authentication: Utilized JWT tokens for authentication, securing user interactions and data.


## Technology Stack:

**Frontend:** Developed the application using React and TypeScript, incorporating the React Context API for streamlined state management and employing Tailwind CSS for a polished and responsive design.
